# Orbital_20

This is the Repository for Orbital project.

## Project Status Until The End of June
1. Implement module list view (Each element navigate to the list with respect to the lis)
2. Implement task list view
3. Main page(Navigate to Module list)
4. Timer for the task
5. Add task and module
6. Delete task and module

### Summary
Main functionality has been implement and most of them work perfectly without bug. 
But the interface design needs to improve since now we only have a basic structure of the view we need to have, 
but not well designed. Also, some minor functionality (like add task to a particular module) has minor bug, but 
we are trying to fix it. 


## Things need to be done in July
1. Implement mutiselect and delete
2. Improve the UI design
3. Add view for statistic data
4. Implement monitor for statistic data
6. Implement a clock view for better interface design
7. Merge the timer to study view and let the timer associate with each task
