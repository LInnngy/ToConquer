## Aim and Motivation
We, college students, all have the problem of procrastinating our assignment till the last minutes. It’s not that we don’t want to get all the work done early, sometimes, there are just too many assignments and we don’t even know where to start.
                    
With that in mind, time management is really crucial for university life, if you want to have a life other than worrying about all the homework all day. Spending one night rushing everything right before the deadline is not the solution, and clearly does not guarantee good quality! 

We want to make a time management application for IOS, so that student can arrange their assignments on the calendar, and use tomato timer during the study time without being distracted by this fantastic world. Also, we provide the analysis of the procedure of finishing this assignment (whether keep delaying the task,etc.). Using this analysis, users can reflect on themselves about how they feel the assignment, what they can improve, how to be more efficient? We will provide a template for the reflection

## Basic Feature
- adding/deleting an assignment.
- Arrange the assignment by the due date.
- List of assignments and categorize them.

## Extension Feature
- Entend the study time after the timer finish but the work haven't done
- Notification when user quit the application and alert if the input is not in correct format
- Giving statistic about how much time the user spent on a certain module and use pie chart to display it
